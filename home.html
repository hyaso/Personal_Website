      Hello everyone! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Hussein Yassine
      and I hope to become a software developer in the near future. I am taking
      a programming bootcamp through Grand Circus focused on C# .NET and I am
      also learning the fundamentals of SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is
      the first website I have ever built. I am excited to learn and grow my
      skills to hopefully become an expert software developer. Please take a few
      moments of your time to explore this website and get to know me.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
    <h2 id="section-developing" ; style="color: blue">Developing</h2>
    <p>
      I have completed a few projects so far while enrolled in this programming
      bootcamp. Please check out my <a href="portfolio.html" target="blank">portfolio</a> page
      for the link to my personal github that contains the repos for all the
      projects I have worked on so far.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-hometown" ; style="color: crimson">Hometown</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in Detroit, Michigan and raised in my hometown of Dearborn,
      Michigan. Dearborn is the seventh most-populated city in Michigan and is
      home to the largest Muslim population in the USA per capita. It is also
      the birthplace and hometown of Henry Ford, the founder of the Ford Motor
      Company. It is known for its diversity, with many of its residents being
      descendants of 19th and 20th century immigrants. For more information on
      my hometown, check out this wikipedia page:
