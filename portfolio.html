          Here is an application I made called Movie Database. The purpose of
          this application is store a list of 10 movies and display them by
          category. The user can enter any of the following categories to
          display the films in the list that match the category: animated,
          drama, horror, scif. After the list is displayed, the user is asked if
          he or she wants to continue. If no, the program ends.

        <p>
            This is an application I made that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors
            against the computer. There are two types of computer players: one who always chooses Rock
            and one who chooses a random option. It gives the user the chance to play again once they win
            or lose.
